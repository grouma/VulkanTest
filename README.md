# IBR VulkanTest
A basic implementation of a Proxy IBR algorithm (http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ProxyIBR/) in Vulkan. Much of the Vulkan boilerplate was adapted from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/.

- GLM (http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html)
- GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/)
- stb_image (https://github.com/nothings/stb)
